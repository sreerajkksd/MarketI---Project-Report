\par  This report discussed the development of a Market Intelligence System aimed at collecting and analysing data from the day to day bussiness activities within an organization and between the organizations.Graph database extends the analysis to much higher level.Relationships between the organizations(ie. Company) are found using this system and were very interesting results were popped up.
\\ The performance of Market Intelligence System can be enhanced further. Some possibilities for the way ahead are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Improving accuracy of Natural Language Processing module(Keyword and relations extractions) by incorporating another NLP tool such as Standford’s Core NLP and cross checking the results with each other.
	\item Modularising the project in a much deeper level. A message distribution system such as Kafka or Amazon’s SQS \& SNS can attached within the module and further parallilsm is possible
	\item Data Source can be extended to support social networks such as LinkedIn ,Facebook etc.
	\item This can be used as a framework  for developing other applications which analyse data from other sources of data.
	\item Supervised learning can be used for tagging data with learning functionality.
	\item Mailing the summarized details of a week’s activities of some organizations in which a particular bussiness user is interested. 
\end{itemize}
